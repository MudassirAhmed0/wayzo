                    Rental Services. Auto-Update Bonus amounts may only be used for Rental Services, and Auto-Update
                    Bonus amounts are not recoverable if your account is closed for any reason.</p>

                    Method was charged. In case you make use of Rental Services that are charged in a currency
                    different than the one in your Auto-Update balance, WAYZ may charge your Payment Method
                    directly.</p>

                    WAYZ account balance; or (b) one of your automatic payments is declined, for any reason
                    whatsoever, including without limitation, expiry of your card: the Auto-Update Amount will not
                    be added to your account balance. In such scenarios, you may be required to separately load your
                    account balance.</p>

                    processors / gateway service providers to facilitate processing of payments, including
                    Auto-Update. Accordingly, you may be required to follow any terms and conditions of such third

                <p class="my-[25px]">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL
                    RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">6.1 Initial Dispute Resolution</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">The WAYZ application contains means to receive support and address any concerns
                    you may have regarding your use of Rental Services. The parties shall use their best efforts
                    through this support process to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage
                    in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating mediation,
                    arbitration, or a lawsuit.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]"> 6.2 Binding Arbitration</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution through the support
                    process, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims,
                    subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to
                    these Terms of Service, and the parties’ relationship with each other shall be finally settled
                    by binding arbitration administered by a mutually agreed upon arbitrator or arbitration service.
                </p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">The arbitrator, and not any court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to
                    resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability,
                    enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service, including, but not limited to any claim
                    that all or any part of these Terms of Service are void or voidable, or whether a claim is
                    subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be
                    available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and
                    binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

                <p class="my-[25px]">To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a
                    lawsuit, WAYZ will pay the additional cost. The arbitration rules also permit you to recover
                    attorney’s fees in certain cases. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision,
                    they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that,
                    in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right
                    to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
                </p>

                <p class="my-[25px]"> 6.3 Location</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">The arbitration will take place in (Courts of KSA )or a mutually agreed upon
                    location.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]"> 6.4 Class Action Waiver.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">the parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their
                    individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the
                    parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. you
                    and wayz agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual
                    capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative
                    proceeding. if any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this
                    paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class
                    basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its
                    entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]"> 6.5 Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through
                    arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its
                    intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral
                    rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may
                    also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s
                    jurisdiction.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">6.6 Right to Opt Out.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class
                    action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out
                    to the following address: Info@wayzco.com</p>
                <p class="my-[25px]">The notice must be sent within15 days of your first use of Services, otherwise
                    you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If
                    you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, WAYZ also will not be bound by them.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">6.7 Changes to this Section.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">WAYZ will provide prior written notice of any changes to this section. Changes
                    will become effective only after prior written notice and will apply prospectively only to any
                    claims arising after the notice period.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">7. Solicited Submission Policy. Where WAYZ has specifically invited or
                    requested submissions or comments, WAYZ encourages you to submit content to WAYZ that you have
                    created for consideration in connection with such requests (“User Submissions”). User
                    Submissions remains the intellectual property of the individual user. By submitting content to
                    WAYZ, you expressly grant WAYZ a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully
                    paid-up worldwide, fully sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,
                    translate, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, perform and display such content
                    and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Submission, in whole or in part,
                    and in any form throughout the world in any media or technology, whether now known or hereafter
                    discovered, including all promotion, advertising, marketing, merchandising, publicity and any
                    other ancillary uses thereof, and including the unfettered right to sublicense such rights, in
                    perpetuity throughout the universe. Any such User Submissions are deemed non-confidential and
                    WAYZ shall be under no obligation to maintain the confidentiality of any information, in
                    whatever form, contained in any User Submission.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">8. Inappropriate User Submissions. WAYZ does not encourage, and does not seek
                    User Submissions that result from any activity that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss,
                    physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or
                    mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any
                    other loss or damage to any person or property; or (iii) may constitute a crime or tort. You
                    agree that you have not and will not engage in any of the foregoing activities in connection
                    with producing your User Submission. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that in
                    conjunction with your submission, you will not inflict emotional distress on other people, will
                    not humiliate other people (publicly or otherwise), will not assault or threaten other people,
                    will not enter onto private property without permission, will not impersonate any other person
                    or misrepresent your affiliation, title, or authority, and will not otherwise engage in any
                    activity that may result in injury, death, property damage, and/or liability of any kind. WAYZ
                    will reject any User Submissions in which WAYZ believes, in its sole discretion, that any such
                    activities have occurred. If notified by a user of a submission that allegedly violates any
                    provision of these Terms of Use, WAYZ reserves the right to determine, in its sole discretion,
                    if such a violation has occurred, and to remove any such submission from the Services at any
                    time and without notice.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">9. Inappropriate Material. You are prohibited from using the Services to post
                    or send any unlawful, infringing, threatening, defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic or
                    profane material or any material that infringes or misappropriates third party intellectual
                    property or could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense or
                    otherwise violate any law. You further agree that sending or posting unsolicited advertisements
                    or “spam” on or through the Services is expressly prohibited by this Agreement. In addition to
                    any remedies that we may have at law or in equity, if we determine, in our sole discretion, that
                    you have violated or are likely to violate the foregoing prohibitions or any applicable rules or
                    policies linked to in these Terms of Service, we may take any action we deem necessary to cure
                    or prevent the violation, including without limitation, banning you from using the Services
                    and/or the immediate removal of the related materials from the Services at any time without
                    notice. We will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities, court order, or subpoena
                    requesting or directing us to disclose the identity of anyone posting such materials.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">10. Access and Interference. You agree that you will not use any robot, spider,
                    scraper or other automated means to access the Services for any purpose without our express
                    written permission. Additionally, you agree that you will not: (i) take any action that imposes,
                    or may impose in our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our
                    infrastructure; (ii) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the site or
                    any activities conducted on the Services; or (iii) bypass any measures we may use to prevent or
                    restrict access to the Services. </p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">11. Right to Takedown Content. Except as disclosed in our Privacy Policy, we

                    Services unless required in the course of normal maintenance of the Services and its systems or
                    unless required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:
                    (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on WAYZ or the Services; (2) protect
                    and defend the rights or property of WAYZ, the Services, or the users of the Services; or (3)

                    obligation to prescreen any such content. However, we shall have the right in our sole
                    discretion to edit, refuse to post or remove any material submitted to or posted on the Services
                    at any time without notice. Without limiting the foregoing, we shall have the right to remove
                    any material that we find to be in violation of the provisions hereof or otherwise
                    objectionable, and the additional right to deny any user who fails to conform to any provision
                    of these Terms of Service access to the Services or any part thereof.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">12. User Published Content. User published Content and User Submissions do not
                    represent the views of WAYZ or any individual associated with WAYZ, and we do not control this
                    Content. In no event shall you represent or suggest, directly or indirectly, WAYZ’s endorsement
                    of user published Content. WAYZ does not vouch for the accuracy or credibility of any user
                    published Content on our Services or User Submissions published through our Services, and do not
                    take any responsibility or assume any liability for any actions you may take as a result of
                    reviewing any such user published Content or User Submission. Through your use of the Services,
                    you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, objectionable, harmful, inaccurate or
                    deceptive. There may also be risks of dealing with underage persons, people acting under false
                    pretense, international trade issues and foreign nationals. By using our Services, you assume
                    all associated risks.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">13. Third Party Links. From time to time, the Services may contain links to
                    websites that are not owned, operated or controlled by WAYZ or its affiliates. All such links
                    are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave the
                    Services. WAYZ is not responsible for any content, materials or other information located on or

                    guarantee, or make any representations or warranties regarding any other websites, or any

                    results that you may obtain from using any other websites. If you decide to access any other
                    websites linked to or from this Services, you do so entirely at your own risk.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">14. Transactional Partners. In some cases we may partner with another entity to
                    co-promote their services within our Services. In these cases, you may be transacting directly
                    with the other party. On those pages or locations, the transactional partners’ brand is clearly
                    visible and their terms of service are posted. When using these partner pages, you are bound by
                    partner terms of service in addition to remaining bound by these WAYZ Terms of Service. When
                    there is a conflict between these Terms of Service and the partner’s terms of service with
                    respect to any dispute relating to WAYZ or the WAYZ Services, these Terms of Service will
                    prevail.</p>

                <p class="my-[25px]">15. Termination. You or we may suspend or terminate your right to use of this
                    Services at any time, for any reason or for no reason. We may also block your access to our
